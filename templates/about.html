                    <p>Hiren Sunil Wadhare, our founder, comes from a family with a rich history in property development. As a third-generation developer, Hiren has been immersed in Constructions from a young age, gaining hands-on experience alongside his grandfather, father, and uncle. With a Master's and Bachelor's degree in Management Studies and two years of experience working as a Relationship Officer at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank in Dubai, Hiren has honed his sales techniques and ability to handle complex situations involving investors, landowners, and customers.</p>
                    <p>Hiren's vision is to develop plots under 500 sq. meters that are often overlooked by larger developers.
